# Prior Art: Canon Cat & The Leap Interface

**Era:** 1987
**Type:** "Semantic Navigation" / Appliance Computer

## Overview
The Canon Cat was a unique "information appliance" designed by Jef Raskin before Archy. It looked like a computer but behaved like a super-powered typewriter. Its defining feature was the **"Leap"** interface—a method of semantic navigation that allowed users to move through text based on *content* rather than *position*.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Leap Keys
The keyboard had two "Leap" keys (Leap Forward, Leap Backward) under the spacebar.
*   **How it worked:** You held "Leap" and typed a string (e.g., "dog"). The cursor instantly jumped to the next occurrence of "dog."
*   **Why it mattered:** This wasn't just "Find." It was the *primary navigation mechanism*. You didn't use a mouse or arrow keys to get somewhere; you "Leapt" there by thinking of the *content* you wanted to reach.

### 2. The "Stream of Consciousness"
The Cat didn't have files. It had one long "Stream" of text (approx. 180 pages). Users just wrote. To find an old letter, you Leapt to "Dear Bob." This removed the cognitive load of file management entirely.

### 3. Invisible State
The system saved everything automatically. If you pulled the plug and plugged it back in, the cursor was at the exact same character. It treated digital memory as permanent, like paper.

## Why It Failed

### 1. Proprietary Hardware & Marketing
Canon didn't understand what they had. They sold it as a "fancy typewriter" rather than a revolutionary computer. It was incompatible with the rising PC/Mac standards.

### 2. Single-Tasking Nature
It was brilliant for text, but couldn't do graphics or games well. As computers became multimedia machines, the Cat's text-only focus made it obsolete.

## Relevance to Intent Kernel
The "Leap" concept is a primitive form of **Intent-Based Navigation**.
*   **Lesson:** Navigation should be driven by **Content**, not **Coordinates**. Users shouldn't click `Folder > Subfolder`. They should "Leap" to the *concept* they want.
*   **Lesson:** The Intent Kernel's "Semantic Linker" is the modern Leap. Instead of typing a string, the user expresses an Intent ("Go to the project plan"), and the system "Leaps" through the semantic space to find the relevant node, regardless of where it is stored.
