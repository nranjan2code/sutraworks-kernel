# Prior Art Research: Intent-Based and Semantic Operating Systems

## Executive Summary

This research archive documents the historical "ancestors" of the Intent Kernel. While no single operating system has previously combined all the core tenets of the Intent Kernel (Intent-Based, Perceptual, Hyperdimensional, Semantic), several systems have attempted to implement specific pillars of this vision.

This collection of documents analyzes these attempts to understand:
1.  **What they achieved:** The specific innovations they pioneered.
2.  **Why they failed:** The technical, economic, or social blockers they encountered.
3.  **The "Why Now":** Why the current technological landscape (AI, Hardware, User Fatigue) makes the Intent Kernel viable today.

## Research Index

### 1. [Symbolics Genera & Lisp Machines](./symbolics_genera.md)
*   **The "Deep Semantic" Ancestor.**
*   **Concept:** A fully object-oriented OS where every piece of data (from network packets to windows) was a live, inspectable object.
*   **Key Lesson:** The power of a unified semantic space vs. the cost of specialized hardware.

### 2. [Microsoft WinFS (Windows Future Storage)](./microsoft_winfs.md)
*   **The "Semantic Data" Ancestor.**
*   **Concept:** Replacing the hierarchical file system with a relational database to allow for semantic querying of data (e.g., "Show me photos of Bob" vs `C:\Photos\Bob.jpg`).
*   **Key Lesson:** The performance cost of semantic indexing on legacy hardware and the complexity of retrofitting legacy ecosystems.

### 3. [Jef Raskin's Archy (The Humane Environment)](./jef_raskin_archy.md)
*   **The "Intent Interface" Ancestor.**
*   **Concept:** A modeless, application-free environment driven by pure intent (Command + Selection).
*   **Key Lesson:** The friction of unlearning the "Desktop Metaphor" and the need for a bridge to existing workflows.

### 4. [Canon Cat & The Leap Interface](./canon_cat.md)
*   **The "Semantic Navigation" Ancestor.**
*   **Concept:** A text-stream-based interface using "Leap" keys for semantic navigation rather than a mouse.
*   **Key Lesson:** The efficiency of keyboard-driven semantic navigation and the risks of proprietary, closed hardware.

### 5. [Analysis: Why Now?](./analysis_why_now.md)
*   **Gap Analysis.**
*   **Synthesis:** A comparative analysis of why these previous attempts failed and how the convergence of LLMs, NPUs, and Hyperdimensional Computing solves the "Manual Tagging" and "Performance" bottlenecks of the past.
